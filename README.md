## Hi there, I'm Sand! ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸŒ± I'm the founder of [Smoke](https://x.com/SmokeOnChain). Smoke is a cross-chain credit protocol that allows users to instantly spend their funds on any chain out there. 

- ğŸ‘¯ If you are a smart contract dev (EVM or SVM), please reach out. Let's work on something marvelous together! 

- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything cross-chain! It's what I spend most of my time thinking about.

- âš¡ Something I strongly believe in: competition leads to better outcomes. More chains is better for all of us (am I biased? NO)
